# 🤖 AI Trading Agent for Stock Market

A **zero-cost, AI-powered trading alert system** that analyzes Indian stock market data and sends **BUY / SELL / HOLD** alerts via **email**. The agent uses **LangChain + Groq LLM (free tier)** for reasoning and **technical indicators** for signal generation.

This project is designed to be **broker-independent**, lightweight, and interview-ready.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 Fetches real-time & recent market data (Yahoo Finance – free)
* 📈 Calculates technical indicators:

  * RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  * Simple Moving Averages (SMA20, SMA50)
* 🧠 AI-powered decision-making using **Groq LLM + LangChain**
* 📬 Sends email alerts with:

  * BUY / SELL / HOLD signal
  * Short explanation (AI-generated)
* ⏱ Can be scheduled (cron / task scheduler) for automated execution
* 💸 **Zero cost** (no paid APIs)

---

## 🧠 High-Level Workflow

1. User defines stock symbols (e.g., NIFTY 50 stocks)
2. Market data is fetched from Yahoo Finance
3. Technical indicators are calculated
4. Data is passed to Groq LLM via LangChain
5. AI generates a trading decision + reasoning
6. Email alert is sent to the user
7. Process repeats at a fixed interval (e.g., every 10 minutes)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

```bash
python main.py
```

Once executed:

* The agent analyzes each configured stock
* AI generates BUY / SELL / HOLD decision
* Email alert is sent to the user

---

## ⏱ Automation (Optional)

### Run every 10 minutes using cron (Linux / macOS)

```bash
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/main.py
```

### Windows Task Scheduler

* Trigger: Time-based (every 10 minutes)
* Action: `python main.py`

## 📧 Sample Email Alert

```
Subject: AI Trade Alert – HINDALCO

Decision: BUY

Reason:
RSI indicates oversold conditions and price is trading above the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential upside momentum.
```

---

## 🧪 Decision Logic (Simplified)

| Condition                  | Signal |
| -------------------------- | ------ |
| RSI < 30 and Price > SMA20 | BUY    |
| RSI > 70 and Price < SMA20 | SELL   |
| Otherwise                  | HOLD   |

> Final explanation is generated by the AI model.
